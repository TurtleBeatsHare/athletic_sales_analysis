Module 5 Challenge: Athletic Sales Analysis

## Pivots aren't just my bindings

I love to ski. My prefered ski bindings are Look Pivots. Seeing as those are so much fun, I'm glad to learn that pivoting in Python is just as fun.

## Challenge Comments

Challenge was pretty straight forward. I completed both the pivot and group_by version of each excersize. 

Hope it's all good! 

Thank you !!
